# C Matrix Strategy Game 🎮

A turn-based strategy game developed in C programming language. This project demonstrates the use of **Matrix Operations** for game map logic and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm for pathfinding mechanisms.

## 🚀 Features
* **Matrix-Based Map System:** The game world is represented and manipulated using 2D arrays (matrices).
* **Pathfinding Logic:** Implements DFS (Depth-First Search) to calculate moves and reachability.
* **Turn-Based Mechanics:** Strategic gameplay where every move counts.
* **Pure C Implementation:** No external heavy game engines, built with standard C libraries.

## 🛠️ How to Compile & Run
You can compile the source code using any standard C compiler (like GCC).

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ShotsMan2/C-Matrix-Strategy-Game.git](https://github.com/ShotsMan2/C-Matrix-Strategy-Game.git)
    ```
2.  Compile the code:
    ```bash
    gcc main.c -o game
    ```
3.  Run the game:
    ```bash
    ./game  # On Linux/Mac
    game.exe # On Windows
    ```

## 📚 Algorithms Used
* **DFS (Depth-First Search):** Used for navigating through the game matrix and finding optimal paths.
* **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Efficient memory management for game structures.
